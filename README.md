# NBA-back-testing
NBA-back-testing is a single page React app that analyzes sports betting results if applied to the 2020/2021 NBA season. Two different betting strategies were examined. The first uses a formula to handicap that games while the second makes its pick based on line movements. I also added components that looked out how the Vegas sportsbook did at predicting games.
